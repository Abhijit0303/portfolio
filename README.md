## Project Setup

This is a personal portfolio built with modern web technologies. The project is still in development, and I'm continuously adding new features and improving the design.

## Technologies Used

- **React** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite** - Next-generation build tool that provides fast and optimized development experience.
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs quickly.
- **Framer Motion** - A library for creating animations and transitions in React apps.
- **Lucid Icon** - Beautiful & consistent icon toolkit made by the community.
- **Yarn** - Package manager used for managing project dependencies.

## Development Setup

Before running the project locally, you need to set up the development environment.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (installed globally)

### Clone the Repository

To get started, first clone this repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/Abhijit0303/portfolio.git

### Install Dependencies

Navigate into your project folder and install the dependencies using Yarn:

    cd portfolio
    yarn install

This will install all the required dependencies listed in `package.json`.

---

## Running the App

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the development server. Vite will take care of hot reloading, so any changes you make will be reflected in real-time.

### Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start the development server:

    yarn dev

This will start the server at `http://localhost:5173`. Open that URL in your browser to view your portfolio page.

### Building for Production

When you're ready to build the project for production, run:

    yarn build

This will generate a `dist/` folder with optimized production-ready files. You can then deploy the app to a hosting provider of your choice.
